                About us
            </p>
            <p id="mission">
                <a id="bold">Our mission:</a> is to involve seafarers in collecting atmospheric data to help fill a major
                gap in climate science,
                specifically in atmospheric research. By tapping into the unique position of those working at sea, we
                can gather crucial
                data to better understand the planet’s changing climate and contribute to the fight against climate
                change.

                Seafarers have a one-of-a-kind perspective on weather patterns, and by giving them the tools and
                knowledge to collect
                and share data, we aim to create a community-based approach to climate research.

                With the support of the Xlporit Foundation, we’re working to provide scientists with the comprehensive
                data they need to
                advance atmospheric research and drive solutions to the climate crisis. Together, we can make a real
                difference in
                climate science and help create a more sustainable future.

                <br> <a id="bold">Who we are:</a>
                We are second-year students at the University of Amsterdam, pursuing a Bachelor's in Computational
                Social Science, and we are passionate about using our skills to make a difference in the fight against
                climate change. This website was created as part of our semester 3 project, where we applied our
                academic knowledge to come up with an innovative plan to fight against climate change.
                We believe climate change is one of the biggest challenges we face, and we’re determined to do our part
                in addressing it. Through this project, we aim to raise awareness, inspire action, and contribute to the
                global conversation about climate solutions. At the University of Amsterdam, we’ve learned the power of
                innovation and collaboration, and we’re excited to bring these values to a cause that we believe can
                truly make a difference.
