                Through the dedication of seafarers and the relentless pursuit of knowledge by scientists, we are
                already making small but remarkable progress in the fight against climate change. The environmental scientists
                leading this groundbreaking project in Utrecht rely on the invaluable data collected by seafarers to
                drive forward climate research and make impactful discoveries.

                At the heart of this mission, the Xplorit Foundation bridges the gap between seafarers and researchers,
                transforming individual efforts into a collective force for global change. This collaboration has
                already borne fruit research like van Herpen (2023) has leveraged atmospheric samples collected
                by seafarers to uncover groundbreaking insights, such as the photocatalytic production of chlorine atoms
                over the North Atlantic. These discoveries have revolutionized our understanding of chlorine’s role in
                influencing greenhouse gases like methane and ozone, bringing us closer to effective climate solutions.

                Xplorit is committed to empowering seafarers, equipping them with the tools and knowledge they need to
                collect atmospheric data with precision and purpose. Every sample, every contribution, is a step
                forward—proving that when we work together, we can turn the tide in the fight for a healthier planet.
