      <p id="intro">Welcome to SEA-US: Connecting Seafarers and Scientists for a Better Planet</p>
      <br>
      <p>SEA-US is here for you and for the Earth. Our mission is to bridge the gap between scientists and seafarers,
        creating a
        powerful collaboration to drive meaningful change for our planet. While climate researchers and seafarers may
        come from
        different worlds, together they form a team capable of making a real difference.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Through SEA-US, we foster a sense of belonging and purpose. Seafarers can share their experiences, leave
        comments, and mark their data collection points on our interactive map, contributing to a connected and thriving
        community. Scientists can stay updated on important weather conditions, enabling them to identify new research
        possibilities. Keep up with the latest findings, from air samples collected by seafarers to the exciting
        breakthroughs made possible through the collaboration between seafarers and scientists.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>By participating, you contribute not only to scientific discovery but also helping the world
        become a better place. SEA-US cause we see you!</p>
